### üÜï LittleLink Button Builder
Want to make your own buttons for LittleLink but you're not too sure where to start? [Check out our new Button Builder](https://builder.littlelink.io). This new builder lets you preview button styles and with a single click, copy the generated CSS code to put in `css/brands.css`, and copy the generated HTML code to put in `index.html`. This builder also helps automate accessibility features by checking contrast ratios and suggesting strokes when needed, ensuring your custom buttons maintain LittleLink's high standards for visibility in both light and dark themes. Design your buttons visually, preview them live, and get ready to go code. [Live Site](https://builder.littlelink.io) | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/sethcottle/littlelink-button-builder)

### üåû Themes and Accessibility
LittleLink offers `auto`, `light`, and `dark` themes right out of the box. If the default color schemes don't match your preference, you can easily customize them by updating the values in `style.css`. You can set any of the themes right in `index.html`. To enhance visual accessibility in both `light` and `dark` modes, buttons lacking sufficient contrast with the background are outlined with an inverse stroke to ensure visibility. While LittleLink emphasizes accessibility, it's important to acknowledge that not all brands incorporated into LittleLink achieve this standard. Branded buttons that come into LittleLink always retain the original essence of the brand and some branded buttons might fall short of optimal accessibility in terms of contrast.

### ü•á Performance

![Performance](https://cdn.cottle.cloud/GitHub/LittleLink/ranking.gif)

LittleLink epitomizes simplicity and minimalism. When evaluating the [LittleLink sample page](https://littlelink.io/sample/seth) (which mirrors a typical LittleLink setup for an individual) through tools such as [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-littlelink-io-sample-seth/17ex80ryq4?form_factor=mobile), showcases LittleLink's excellence with 100/100 in Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO. My initial vision for LittleLink was to craft it from the fundamentals. LittleLink leverages it's own vanilla `css` to remove the unnecessary bloat you would get from using a large framework for a page that requires nothing more than simplicity.
